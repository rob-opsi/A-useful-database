# A useful Database
This is a php application which enables the creation and maintenance of a MySQL database or similar. At present it allows the collection and storage of contacts names & addresses, along with details of the following that you may own:-

     Books,
     Music,
     Games,
     More to come.

One feature enables you to "check out" any item above, against any person in your contacts list. I designed this feature so i could track which of my friend's had borrowed things from me, logging when it was logged out, and you cannot delete any contact from the database without first "checking in" the item that they have outstanding.

I created this as i could find nothing on the web that contained the functions that i required. Help is always extremely welcome!
